# fby-toptal-challenge

At Toptal we love a good coding challenge. As the Community Sponsors of f(by) we thought it would be fun to create a coding challenge for attendees to prove their coding cred.

Send your answers to asia@toptal.com before December 8 and the winner will be chosen from random from the entries. The winner can pick up the prize at f(by) at the Toptal table. First 10 people who will send the correct answer will get a discount for the conference ticket.

<b>Coding Challenge Given</b>: You have a programming language without lazy sequences support (for example Javascript). You would like to perform multiple operations on a big array by chaining them together. For example: array.map(doOneThing).map(doAnotherThing).map(…) and so on…
In JavaScript each transforming function will create an intermediate collection and consume extra memory. Do you know a way to avoid this but keep the same nice chaining of operations in one pipeline?
